## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1] - 2026-05-18

First crates.io release. All three Rust crates published at this version
(`hypersync-solana-schema`, `hypersync-solana-net-types`, `hypersync-client-solana`).

### Added

- Cargo workspace at the repo root covering all three Rust crates plus a
  Node.js binding crate under `node/`.
- MPL-2.0 LICENSE, README, CHANGELOG.
- Per-crate metadata (description, license, repository, homepage, keywords,
  categories, readme).
- napi-rs Node bindings under `node/` exposing `SolanaClient` with
  `getHeight()` and `query()`.

### Fixed

- Client `Cargo.toml` path dependencies now resolve inside this repo when used
  standalone (previously only resolved as a path dep from the main hypersync repo).
